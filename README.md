## 📖 **Overview**

This project uses deep learning to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Built with Streamlit, the app is simple to use and accessible via any browser.

### **Features**
- **Interactive Canvas**: Draw digits directly in the app.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Get instant results.
- **Powered by TensorFlow**: Uses a pre-trained model for accuracy.

## 📋 **How It Works**

1. **Draw a Digit**: Use the app's canvas to draw a digit.
2. **Predict**: The app preprocesses your drawing and predicts the digit using a TensorFlow model.
3. **Real-Time Feedback**: See the prediction instantly.

## 📦 **Dependencies**

The app requires the following Python libraries:

- `streamlit`
- `streamlit-drawable-canvas`
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `Pillow`

Install them via `requirements.txt`.
